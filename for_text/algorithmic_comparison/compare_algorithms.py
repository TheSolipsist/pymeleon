"""
Create 4-5 DSLs and come up with 5 examples for each, ascending complexity
Compare algorithms with and without neural net for each DSL and measure mean
For each example write an explanation for what it does
Measure dataset generation time, DSL training time, mean inference time (100 iterations or sth, check how many of them find the solution)
Table, on the left problem name, 2 columns describing search time and results without neural net,
